A slot machine that works with kitty cookies!
Feed the cat to start the game, then you can pull his arm so the wheels start spinning.
Each time the wheels stop you will have an opportunity to select which wheels should stop from being spinned again.
You hae 5 rounds to try to match the three wheels, good luck!

The game features an event driven finite state machine to control the game flow and connection to your facebook account, 
so you can see the profile pictures of your friends as icons for the spinning wheels.
